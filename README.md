# ABOUT

A collection of mods for Project Zomboid that add what I think are useful QOL features.

## CRAFT GAS CANS

Allows you to craft gas cans using 2 empty bleach bottles, 4 adhesive tape (or 2 duct tape), and a pair of scissors. The recipe is found in the Survivalist tab of the crafting menu.

## DISMANTLE ALARM CLOCKS

Allows you to dismantle alarm clocks using a screwdriver to acquire 1 Electronics Scrap.

## TURN EMPTY CANS INTO SCRAP METAL

Allows you to turn 8 empty cans of a particular type (beer/pop/tin) into a single piece of scrap metal using a hammer. Recipe is found in the Metalworking tab of the crafting menu and awards 5 Metalworking XP on completion.

## RECYCLE BAGS

If you've got too many school bags, lunchboxes, satchels and other unwanted bags cluttering up your storage, this mod allows you to turn them into either leather strips or scrap metal as long as you have the right skill.

Recycling bags will provide materials based on what I think the item would be made of. For example, lunchboxes will provide scrap metal, while hiking bags will provide leather strips. All recipes can be performed while on the floor, but not while moving.

Recipes are split into categories: Cloth Bags, Small/Medium/Large/Very Large Leather Bags and Metal Containers (based on carrying capacity, obtained from the PZ Wiki).

For the leather bags, you will need a pair of scissors, while you need a hammer for the metal items. Recycling cloth bags does not require any tools. All of the recipes are found in the 'Bag Recycling' tab of the crafting menu.

Cloth Bags: Tote Bag and Sack. Grants 1 ripped sheet and 3 Tailoring XP.

Small Leather Bags: Fanny Pack, Satchel, Flight Case, Guitar Case and Briefcase. Grants 1 leather strip and 5 Tailoring XP.
Medium Leather Bags: School Bag, Duffel Bag, Golf Bag, Handbag and Purse. Grants 2 leather strips and 10 Tailoring XP. Requires a Tailoring skill of 1.
Large Leather Bags: Hiking Bag, Big Hiking Bag and Suitcase. Grants 3 leather strips and 15 Tailoring XP. Requires a Tailoring skill of 2.
Separate recipes exist for recycling Large/Military Backpacks. Both grant 4 leather strips and 20 Tailoring XP and require a Tailoring skill of 3.

Recycling leather bags will grant one thread at Tailoring level 3, and two thread at Tailoring level 7.

Not recycled by this mod: Seed Bag, Cooler, Plastic Bag, and Garbage Bag.
