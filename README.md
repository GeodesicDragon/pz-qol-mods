# ABOUT

A collection of mods for Project Zomboid that add what I think are useful QOL features.

## CRAFT GAS CANS

Allows you to craft gas cans using 2 empty bleach bottles, 4 adhesive tape (or 2 duct tape), and a pair of scissors. The recipe is found in the Survivalist tab of the crafting menu.

## DISMANTLE ALARM CLOCKS

Allows you to dismantle alarm clocks using a screwdriver to acquire 1 Electronics Scrap.

## TURN EMPTY CANS INTO SCRAP METAL

Allows you to turn 8 empty cans of a particular type (beer/pop/tin) into a single piece of scrap metal using a hammer. Recipes are found in the Can Recycling tab of the crafting menu; each one awards 5 Metalworking XP on completion.

## RECYCLE BAGS

If you've got too many school bags, lunchboxes, satchels and other unwanted bags cluttering up your storage, this mod allows you to turn them into either leather strips or scrap metal as long as you have the right skill.

Recycling bags will provide materials based on what I think the item would be made of. For example, lunchboxes will provide scrap metal, while hiking bags will provide leather strips. All recipes can be performed while on the floor, but not while moving.

Recipes are split into categories: Cloth Bags, Small/Medium/Large Leather Bags and Metal Containers.

For the leather bags, you will need a pair of scissors, while you need a hammer for the metal items. Recycling cloth bags does not require any tools. All of the recipes are found in the 'Bag Recycling' tab of the crafting menu.

Cloth Bags: Sack, Seed Bag and Tote Bag. Grants 1 ripped sheet and 3 Tailoring XP.

Small Leather Bags: Fanny Pack, Satchel, Flight Case, Guitar Case and Briefcase. Grants 1 leather strip and 5 Tailoring XP.
Medium Leather Bags: School Bag, Duffel Bag, Golf Bag, Handbag and Purse. Grants 2 leather strips and 10 Tailoring XP. Requires a Tailoring skill of 1.
Large Leather Bags: Hiking Bag, Big Hiking Bag and Suitcase. Grants 3 leather strips and 15 Tailoring XP. Requires a Tailoring skill of 2.
Separate recipes exist for recycling Large/Military Backpacks. Both grant 4 leather strips and 20 Tailoring XP and require a Tailoring skill of 3.

Recyling leather bags will grant one spool of thread at Tailoring level 3, and two spools of thread at Tailoring level 7.

Metal Containers: First Aid Kit, Lunchbox, Sewing Kit, Pistol Case and Toolbox. Grants 1 scrap metal and 5 Metalworking XP. Requires a Metalworking skill of 1.

Not recycled by this mod: Cooler, Plastic Bag, and Garbage Bag.

## PACKAGE FABRICS

Allows you to put 100 ripped sheets, denim strips or leather strips into boxes to save weight.

100 of either sheets/denim/leather has a combined weight of 5 (0.05x100), while boxes have a weight of 1.5 (70% less).

Only clean materials can be packaged this way (at least for now; I might change it given sufficient demand).

## MAKE CIGARETTES

Allows you to craft 100 cigarettes using 10 sheets of paper and a sack (don't ask how that works).

Recipe must first be learned by reading a magazine; they can be found in bookstores, some crates, classrooms, filing cabinets, libraries, living rooms, lockers, magazine racks and rarely on zombies.
